# Python Project Starter - User Testing Recruitment Email

## Subject: Invitation to Test a New Python Tool for Beginners

---

Dear [Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out because we've developed a new command-line tool called **Python Project Starter (PPS)** designed to make Python project setup and management easier for non-technical users and beginners.

## What is Python Project Starter?

Python Project Starter (PPS) simplifies the process of creating and managing Python projects by providing straightforward commands for:

- Creating new projects with proper structure and best practices
- Managing version control with simplified Git commands
- Setting up development environments
- Maintaining project configuration

Our goal is to reduce the learning curve for beginners and help them focus on writing code rather than struggling with setup and tooling.

## Why We Need Your Help

We're looking for people with various levels of programming experience to test our tool and provide feedback. Your perspective would be particularly valuable as someone with [their specific background/experience level].

## What Testing Involves

Participating in the test would involve:

1. A 30-60 minute session where you'll try using the tool to perform basic tasks
2. Sharing your screen so we can observe how you interact with the tool
3. Providing feedback on your experience
4. Filling out a short questionnaire afterward

Alternatively, if you prefer to test on your own time, we can provide instructions for self-guided testing.

## Requirements

To participate, you'll need:

- A computer with Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Python 3.10 or newer installed
- Git installed and configured
- 30-60 minutes of uninterrupted time
- Willingness to share your honest feedback

## Next Steps

If you're interested in participating, please reply to this email with:

1. Your preferred date and time for a testing session (or if you prefer self-guided testing)
2. Your level of experience with programming and Python specifically
3. The operating system you'll be using

We'll then send you detailed instructions on how to proceed.

## Compensation

While this is a volunteer opportunity, we're offering [compensation details if applicable, e.g., "a $25 gift card as a token of our appreciation"] for your time and valuable feedback.

Thank you for considering this request. Your input will directly help make Python more accessible to new developers.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
[Your Contact Information]

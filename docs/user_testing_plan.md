# Python Project Starter - User Testing Plan

This document outlines the plan for testing the Python Project Starter (PPS) tool with non-technical users to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement.

## Testing Objectives

1. Evaluate the usability of the tool for non-technical users
2. Identify pain points and barriers to adoption
3. Assess the clarity of error messages and documentation
4. Gather suggestions for feature enhancements
5. Understand the overall user experience

## Target User Profiles

We want to test with a diverse range of users, focusing primarily on:

1. **Complete beginners**: No prior programming experience
2. **Novice developers**: Some programming experience but limited Python knowledge
3. **Experienced developers**: Familiar with programming but new to Python
4. **Domain experts**: Professionals from non-CS fields (data science, research, etc.)

## Test Environment Setup

Each participant will need:

1. A computer with Windows, macOS, or Linux
2. Python 3.10+ installed
3. Git installed and configured with basic credentials
4. Internet connection for installation
5. 30-60 minutes of uninterrupted time

## Testing Methodology

### Remote Testing

1. Schedule 30-60 minute video calls with participants
2. Use screen sharing to observe their workflow
3. Have a moderator guide them through the session
4. Record sessions (with permission) for later analysis

### Self-Guided Testing

For participants who cannot attend a live session:

1. Provide detailed instructions via email
2. Ask participants to record their screen if possible
3. Have them take notes during the process
4. Follow up with a structured interview or feedback form

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Installation & First Use

Tasks:
1. Install the Python Project Starter tool
2. View the help documentation
3. Create a new Python project using the `pps new` command
4. Explore the generated project structure

### Scenario 2: Basic Project Management

Tasks:
1. Using the project created in Scenario 1, make some changes to files
2. Use `pps status` to check what changes were made
3. Use `pps save` to commit the changes with a message
4. Make more changes and repeat the process

### Scenario 3: Project Synchronization

Tasks:
1. Configure a remote repository (GitHub/GitLab/etc.)
2. Use `pps sync` to synchronize the local project with the remote

### Scenario 4: Advanced Scenarios (Optional)

Tasks:
1. Create a new Python package with dependencies
2. Set up and activate the virtual environment
3. Install additional dependencies
4. Run tests and view results

## Data Collection

We will collect the following data from each session:

1. Success/failure rates for each task
2. Time taken to complete each task
3. Number and types of errors encountered
4. Verbal feedback during the session
5. Responses to structured post-test questions
6. Written feedback via the user feedback form

## Feedback Analysis

After collecting data from at least 5-10 users, we will:

1. Categorize feedback by theme (UI, documentation, features, bugs)
2. Identify common pain points and frustrations
3. Prioritize issues based on severity and frequency
4. Develop an action plan for improvements

## Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Recruit participants and schedule sessions
2. **Week 2-3**: Conduct user testing sessions
3. **Week 4**: Analyze feedback and compile results
4. **Week 5**: Develop improvement plan based on feedback

## Reporting

We will create a comprehensive report including:

1. Summary of findings
2. Detailed analysis of user behavior
3. Recommendations for immediate improvements
4. Long-term roadmap based on user needs
5. Specific changes to prioritize for the next release

## Next Steps

1. Create a participant recruitment email
2. Set up a scheduling system for sessions
3. Prepare the testing environment and instructions
4. Develop more detailed task scripts for each scenario
5. Create a feedback collection system

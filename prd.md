## GitHub Integration in VS Code

### Setting Up Git and GitHub

VS Code comes with built-in Git integration, making version control seamless within your development environment. To get started:

1. **Install Git**: Ensure Git is installed on your system and configured with your credentials.

2. **Initialize a repository**: If starting a new project, initialize a Git repository using the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and select "Git: Initialize Repository" or use the terminal command:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. **Clone a repository**: To work with an existing GitHub repository, use "Git: Clone" from the command palette or click the "Clone Repository" button in the Source Control view (third icon in the Activity Bar).

### Source Control View

The Source Control view in VS Code (accessible via the sidebar or Ctrl+Shift+G) provides a visual interface for Git operations:

1. **Staging changes**: Click the "+" icon next to modified files to stage them for commit.

2. **Committing changes**: Enter a descriptive commit message in the input box at the top and press Ctrl+Enter (or Cmd+Enter on macOS) to commit.

3. **Pushing changes**: Click the "Synchronize Changes" button in the status bar or use "Git: Push" from the command palette.

4. **Branch management**: The current branch is displayed in the status bar. Click on it to switch branches, create new ones, or merge existing branches.

### GitHub Pull Requests and Issues Extension

Install the "GitHub Pull Requests and Issues" extension to enhance your GitHub workflow directly within VS Code:

1. **Authentication**: The extension will prompt you to sign in to your GitHub account. Follow the instructions to authenticate through your web browser.

2. **Pull requests**: Browse, review, and merge pull requests directly in VS Code. Add comments, suggest changes, and approve or request changes without leaving the editor.

3. **Issues**: Create, view, and manage GitHub issues. You can create new issues, view your assigned issues, and even work on them directly in VS Code.

4. **Code reviews**: The extension provides a dedicated view for code reviews, allowing you to see diffs, add comments, and navigate through changes efficiently.

5. **@-mentions and #-references**: Within the editor and Source Control input box, VS Code supports auto-completion for GitHub users (@-mentions) and issues (#-references).

### GitHub Repositories Extension

For scenarios where you need to quickly access and work with remote repositories without a full local clone, the "GitHub Repositories" extension is invaluable:

1. **Remote browsing**: Open a repository directly by URL or search for it within GitHub.

2. **Virtual filesystem**: The extension creates an in-memory virtual filesystem, allowing you to view and edit files in the remote repository.

3. **Direct commits**: Make changes and commit them directly to the remote repository, similar to using the GitHub web interface but with the power of VS Code.

This approach is particularly useful for quick edits or code reviews when a full clone is unnecessary.## Advanced Debugging Techniques

### Configuring the Python Debugger

VS Code's Python debugger offers powerful features that go beyond basic breakpoints and stepping. To get started, create a launch configuration by clicking on the Run and Debug icon in the sidebar and then "create a launch.json file."

Here's a comprehensive launch.json example that covers various debugging scenarios:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python: Current File",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${file}",
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "justMyCode": false
        },
        {
            "name": "Python: Module",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "module": "mymodule",
            "console": "integratedTerminal"
        },
        {
            "name": "Python: Django",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/manage.py",
            "args": [
                "runserver"
            ],
            "django": true,
            "justMyCode": false
        },
        {
            "name": "Python: Flask",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "module": "flask",
            "env": {
                "FLASK_APP": "app.py",
                "FLASK_DEBUG": "1"
            },
            "args": [
                "run",
                "--no-debugger"
            ],
            "jinja": true,
            "justMyCode": false
        },
        {
            "name": "Python: Remote Attach",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "attach",
            "connect": {
                "host": "localhost",
                "port": 5678
            },
            "pathMappings": [
                {
                    "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
                    "remoteRoot": "."
                }
            ],
            "justMyCode": false
        }
    ]
}
```

### Advanced Debugging Features

1. **Conditional breakpoints**: Right-click on a breakpoint and add a condition that must be true for the breakpoint to be triggered. This is useful for debugging specific scenarios or iterations.

2. **Logpoints**: Instead of stopping execution, logpoints print a message to the console when reached. Right-click the gutter and select "Add Logpoint" to create one.

3. **Data visualization**: The Variables panel shows the values of local variables. For more complex structures, you can use the Debug Console to execute expressions and even visualize data with commands like `!plt.plot(x, y)` if you're using matplotlib.

4. **Watch expressions**: Add expressions to the Watch panel to monitor their values as you step through your code.

5. **Call stack navigation**: The Call Stack panel shows the execution path, allowing you to navigate up and down the stack to examine the program state at different levels.

6. **No-config debugging**: For quick debugging without creating a launch.json file, simply use the debugpy prefix in your terminal:

   ```bash
   debugpy script.py
   ```

7. **Stepping controls**: Master the stepping controls in the debug toolbar:
   - Step Over (F10): Execute the current line and move to the next one
   - Step Into (F11): Enter into a function call
   - Step Out (Shift+F11): Complete the current function and return to the caller
   - Continue (F5): Run until the next breakpoint

8. **Just My Code**: Toggle the "justMyCode" setting to control whether to step into library code or stay within your own code.# Python Development Best Practices for 2025 in VS Code

This comprehensive guide outlines the latest best practices for Python development in 2025, focusing on modern tooling, project structure, VS Code extensions, type checking, project templates, testing frameworks, and CI/CD integration. Following these practices will help you create maintainable, efficient, and high-quality Python code.

## Modern Python Tooling in 2025

### Package and Environment Management

#### UV - The New Standard

UV has emerged as the premier tool for Python package and project management in 2025, replacing many traditional tools like pip, pip-tools, pipx, poetry, pyenv, virtualenv, and more. UV is built in Rust by the team behind Ruff, making it significantly faster (up to 20x) than older tools.

Key UV commands:
```bash
# Create a virtual environment
uv venv

# Install dependencies from pyproject.toml
uv sync

# Add a dependency
uv add requests

# Install with development dependencies
uv sync --dev
```

UV's ability to reuse packages from a global cache and its seamless integration with VS Code makes it the preferred choice for managing Python environments and dependencies.

### Code Quality Tools

#### Ruff - All-in-One Linter and Formatter

Ruff has now become the standard for Python linting and formatting, effectively replacing multiple tools including Flake8, Black, isort, pycodestyle, and more. It's extremely fast due to being written in Rust and provides comprehensive linting capabilities with over 700 built-in rules.

Configure Ruff in your `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.ruff]
line-length = 88
target-version = "py312"

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = ["E", "F", "W", "I", "N", "UP", "B", "A"]
ignore = ["E203"]  # Conflicts with Black

[tool.ruff.format]
quote-style = "double"
indent-style = "space"
line-ending = "auto"
```

Key Ruff commands:
```bash
# Check for issues
uv run ruff check .

# Fix automatically fixable issues
uv run ruff check --fix .

# Format code
uv run ruff format .
```

### Project Structure

#### Src Layout vs Flat Layout

The Python community now strongly recommends using the "src layout" for projects, where your package code is placed in a src/ directory rather than the project root. This structure ensures proper package installation and testing, preventing issues with imports.

Example of the recommended src layout structure:

```
my_project/
├── README.md
├── pyproject.toml
├── src/
│   └── my_package/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── module_a.py
│       └── module_b.py
└── tests/
    ├── test_module_a.py
    └── test_module_b.py
```

The src layout requires installation of the project to run its code, which helps catch installation issues early and prevents accidentally using the development code instead of the installed code during testing.

### Configuration with pyproject.toml

The pyproject.toml file has become the standard central configuration file for Python projects, replacing multiple tool-specific files. It's used to configure the build system, project metadata, and tool-specific settings.

Basic pyproject.toml structure:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[project]
name = "my_package"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A sample Python package"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.10"
license = {text = "MIT"}
dependencies = [
    "requests>=2.30.0",
    "pydantic>=2.5.0",
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "ruff",
    "pytest",
    "mypy",
]

[tool.ruff]
line-length = 88

[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests"]
pythonpath = ["."]
```

## VS Code Setup for Python in 2025

7. **Python Docstring Generator**
   Helps maintain clear and comprehensive documentation by automatically generating docstring templates in various formats (Google, NumPy, etc.).

8. **Visual Studio IntelliCode**
   This AI-powered extension provides intelligent code completion and suggestions based on patterns in your code. It learns from your codebase to provide tailored suggestions, helping you write code faster and more accurately.

### VS Code Settings for Python

Configure VS Code for optimal Python development by adding these settings to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
    "python.languageServer": "Pylance",
    "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "basic",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.fixAll": true,
        "source.organizeImports": true
    },
    "python.analysis.extraPaths": ["${workspaceFolder}/src"],
    "python.analysis.enableEditableInstalls": true,
    "python.testing.pytestEnabled": true,
    "python.testing.unittestEnabled": false,
    "python.testing.nosetestsEnabled": false,
    "python.linting.enabled": true,
    "python.linting.flake8Enabled": false,
    "python.linting.mypyEnabled": true,
    "python.formatting.provider": "none",
    "[python]": {
        "editor.defaultFormatter": "charliermarsh.ruff",
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        "editor.rulers": [88]
    },
    "python.terminal.activateEnvironment": true,
    "python.terminal.executeInFileDir": true,
    "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows": "Command Prompt",
    "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.linux": "bash",
    "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.osx": "zsh"
}
```

### Leveraging the Integrated Terminal

VS Code's integrated terminal is a powerful feature that streamlines your Python development workflow. It allows you to run scripts, execute commands, and manage your project directly from within the editor window, eliminating the need to switch between applications.

To open the integrated terminal, use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+` (backtick) or `Ctrl+J`. The terminal will open in the context of your project's root directory.

Key benefits of the integrated terminal:

1. **Automatic environment activation**: When you open a terminal in VS Code, it automatically activates the Python interpreter associated with your selected virtual environment.

2. **Multiple terminal instances**: You can create multiple terminal instances for different tasks (e.g., one for running the application, another for tests, and another for Git commands).

3. **Split terminal views**: You can split the terminal view horizontally or vertically to see multiple terminals simultaneously.

4. **Command history**: The integrated terminal maintains command history, allowing you to easily repeat previous commands using the up arrow key.

Configure your terminal preferences in VS Code settings to match your development workflow, including default shell, font size, and color scheme.

## Type Checking Best Practices

Python's support for static type checking has continued to mature, and in 2025 there are two main options for type checking: Mypy and Pyright (which powers Pylance).

### Mypy vs Pyright

**Mypy** was the original type checker for Python and is still widely used. It runs as a standalone command-line tool and works well with traditional Python codebases. Key features:
- Established, mature project with consistent behavior
- Strong integration with popular frameworks
- Detailed error messages
- Configurable strictness levels

**Pyright/Pylance** is Microsoft's type checker that powers VS Code's Pylance extension. It has seen significant adoption due to its performance and IDE integration. Key advantages:
- Up to 3-5x faster than Mypy on large codebases
- Better recovery from syntax errors
- Designed for IDE integration with language server protocol
- Performs type checking on all code, not just annotated functions
- No dependency on the Python runtime

For VS Code users, Pylance (with Pyright) is the recommended choice due to its tight integration and performance.

### Type Checking Configuration

In your `pyproject.toml`, configure type checking:

```toml
[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.12"
disallow_untyped_defs = true
disallow_incomplete_defs = true
check_untyped_defs = true
disallow_untyped_decorators = true
no_implicit_optional = true
strict_optional = true
warn_redundant_casts = true
warn_return_any = true
warn_unused_ignores = true

# Or if using pyright/pylance:
[tool.pyright]
include = ["src"]
exclude = ["**/node_modules", "**/__pycache__"]
typeCheckingMode = "basic"  # Use "strict" for more rigorous checking
```

## Project Templates and Bootstrapping

In 2025, project templates and bootstrapping tools help standardize project setup and ensure consistent structure across codebases.

### Cookiecutter and Cruft

**Cookiecutter** remains the top templating tool for creating project skeletons in 2025, with **Cruft** providing additional capabilities for template updates.

Benefits of using Cookiecutter + Cruft:
- Standardized project structure across teams
- Consistent configuration files (pyproject.toml, pre-commit, etc.)
- Built-in best practices
- With Cruft, projects can be updated when the template changes

Example workflow:
```bash
# Create a new project from a template
cruft create https://github.com/organization/python-template

# Later, update an existing project when the template changes
cruft check  # Check if template updates are available
cruft update  # Apply template updates to the project
```

## Workflow Best Practices

### Development Workflow

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Create a virtual environment with UV: `uv venv`
   - Install dependencies: `uv sync`
   - Install dev dependencies: `uv sync --dev`

2. **Code Quality Automation**
   Use pre-commit hooks to automate code quality checks before each commit. This ensures consistent code quality across your team.

   Example `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   repos:
   - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
     rev: v4.5.0
     hooks:
     - id: trailing-whitespace
     - id: end-of-file-fixer
     - id: check-yaml
     - id: check-added-large-files
   
   - repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
     rev: v0.3.0
     hooks:
     - id: ruff
       args: [--fix]
     - id: ruff-format
   ```

3. **Testing**
   Implement comprehensive testing with pytest and use coverage tools to ensure proper test coverage.

   Best practices for pytest:
   - Use the src layout to ensure tests run against the installed package
   - Organize tests by modules/components
   - Use fixtures for test setup and teardown
   - Use parameterized tests for testing multiple inputs
   - Use markers to categorize tests (e.g., slow, integration, unit)

   Example pytest configuration in `pyproject.toml`:
   ```toml
   [tool.pytest.ini_options]
   testpaths = ["tests"]
   python_files = "test_*.py"
   python_classes = "Test*"
   python_functions = "test_*"
   markers = [
       "slow: marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m \"not slow\"')",
       "integration: marks integration tests",
   ]
   ```

### Documentation

Documentation is crucial for maintainability. Use docstrings for modules, classes, and functions, and maintain a comprehensive README file with project overview, installation instructions, and usage examples.

Example of good docstring formatting:
```python
def calculate_factorial(n):
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a number.
    
    Args:
        n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of.
    
    Returns:
        int: The factorial of the number.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If n is negative.
    """
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers")
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * calculate_factorial(n - 1)
```

## CI/CD Integration

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment have become standard practices for Python projects in 2025, with GitHub Actions being one of the most popular choices due to its simplicity and integration with GitHub repositories.

### GitHub Actions for Python Projects

Create a basic Python CI workflow in `.github/workflows/python-ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: Python CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.12'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install pre-commit
      - name: Run pre-commit hooks
        run: pre-commit run --all-files

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ['3.10', '3.11', '3.12']
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install uv
          uv venv
          uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
      - name: Test with pytest
        run: pytest --cov=src
      - name: Upload coverage reports
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
```

### Pre-commit CI

To ensure that all pre-commit hooks pass in CI, you have several options:
1. Use the pre-commit GitHub Action as shown above
2. Use the dedicated pre-commit.ci service
3. Use a custom implementation that runs `pre-commit run --all-files`

Pre-commit hooks should be fast to avoid disrupting workflow. If a hook takes too long (like extensive tests), consider running it only in CI rather than pre-commit.

## Security Best Practices

Security is a top concern in Python development in 2025. Integrate these practices into your workflow:

1. **Use Dependabot or similar tools** to automatically detect and update vulnerable dependencies
2. **Enable security scanning** in your CI/CD pipeline
3. **Validate input data** to prevent injection attacks
4. **Use environment variables** for secrets and configure them securely in CI
5. **Regularly update dependencies** using `uv upgrade` or an equivalent command

Example Dependabot configuration in `.github/dependabot.yml`:
```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
```

## Summary

The Python development landscape in 2025 has evolved significantly with a focus on speed, efficiency, and maintainability. UV has revolutionized package management, while Ruff has replaced multiple linting and formatting tools with a single, fast alternative. Type checking has matured with both Mypy and Pylance offering robust solutions. The src-layout has become the recommended project structure, and the pyproject.toml file serves as the central configuration hub.

Project templating with Cookiecutter and Cruft helps standardize development practices across teams and projects. Pre-commit hooks and CI/CD pipelines ensure consistent code quality, while VS Code's ecosystem of Python extensions provides a powerful development environment.

VS Code's integrated terminal, advanced debugging capabilities, and seamless GitHub integration significantly enhance the developer experience, reducing context switching and streamlining the development workflow. The built-in Git tools and GitHub extensions make version control and collaboration straightforward without leaving the editor.

By adopting these modern tools and practices, you can develop Python code more efficiently, collaborate more effectively with your team, and maintain higher quality standards across your projects. As the Python ecosystem continues to evolve, staying informed about new tools, extensions, and best practices will ensure your development environment remains optimized for productivity and code quality.
